  utter_greet:
  - text: |
            Hi! How's it going? I was wondering whether
            Or not we shall write a limerick together

  utter_goodbye:
  - text: |
            Well then, goodbye, I'll now disappear
            but when you need me I'm always here

            I'm Richard Lime, but you can call me Rick.
            I can help you write poems in a way nice and quick.
            I have a knack for weird, nonsense verse
            And with a limerick we can rehearse!

  utter_intro:
  - text: |
            A limerick is a nonsense composition
            Belonging to the English tradition.
            It lasts five lines (AABBA)
            And we can write one if you think that's okay

  utter_example:
  - text: |
            The limerick packs laughs anatomical
            Into space that is quite economical.
            But the good ones I've seen
            So seldom are clean
            And the clean ones so seldom are comical.

            What do you want it to be about?
            I need a who, a where and a how!

  utter_was_it_good:

            How did you like it? I think it's not bad.
            Don't worry, if you hate it I won't be sad.

  utter_could_be_worse:
  - text: |
            Maybe it's because I'm a little bit hoarse
            But do believe me: it could have been worse!

  utter_glad_you_enjoyed:
  - text: |
            I'm glad you like it. Would you like to hear
            One written by the founder Edward Lear?

  utter_bad_example:
  - text: |
            There was a young man from Japan
            Whose limericks never would scan.
            And when they asked why,
            He said "I do try!
            But when I get to the last line I try to fit in as many words as I can.

  - text: |
            There was an Old Man in a boat,
            Who said, 'I'm afloat, I'm afloat!'
            When they said, 'No! you ain't!'
            He was ready to faint,
            That unhappy Old Man in a boat.
              - Edward Lear
