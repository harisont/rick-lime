  utter_greet:
  - text: |
            Hi! How's it going? I was wondering whether
            Or not we shall write a limerick together

  utter_goodbye:
  - text: |
            Well then, goodbye, I'll now disappear
            but when you need me I'm always here!

            I'm Richard Lime, but you can call me Rick.
            I can help you write poems in a way nice and quick.
            I have a knack for weird, nonsense verse
            And with a limerick we can rehearse!

  utter_intro:
  - text: |
            A limerick is a nonsense composition
            Belonging to the English tradition.
            It lasts five lines (AABBA)
            And we can write one if you think that's okay

  utter_example:
  - text: |
            The limerick packs laughs anatomical
            Into space that is quite economical.
            But the good ones I've seen
            So seldom are clean
            And the clean ones so seldom are comical.

  utter_about:
  - text: |
            What do you want it to be about?
            I need a who, a where and a how!

  utter_was_it_good:
  - text: |
            How did you like it? I think it's not bad.
            Don't worry, if you hate it I won't be sad.

  utter_could_be_worse:
  - text: |
            Maybe it's because I'm a little bit hoarse
            But do believe me: it could have been worse!

  utter_glad_you_enjoyed:
  - text: |
            I'm glad you like it. Would you like to hear
            One written by the founder Edward Lear?

  utter_bad_example:
  - text: |
            There was a young man from Japan
            Whose limericks never would scan.
            And when they asked why,
            He said "I do try!
            But when I get to the last line I try to fit in as many words as I can.

  utter_lear_example:
  - text: |
            There was an Old Man in a boat,
            Who said, 'I'm afloat, I'm afloat!'
            When they said, 'No! you ain't!'
            He was ready to faint,
            That unhappy Old Man in a boat.
              - Edward Lear

  utter_ask_who:

            I'd like no know who the character is,
            if it's a boy, a cat or a Miss

  utter_ask_where:
  - text: |
            Where does the action takes place this round?
            Enter a region, country or town

  utter_ask_how:
  - text: |
            For today's subject give me an adjective:
            Anything works, you can be creative!

  utter_prompt_verse2:
  - text: |
            About the {who} I want to know more:
            Writing the second verse is your chore.
            To rhyme with {where} don't you forget!
            And if in trouble, read what I suggest:

  utter_prompt_verse3:
  - text: |
            To the short middle verses we've come:
            write down the first one and I'll tell you some
            rhymes you could use to make the second fun
            so that you're able to choose the best one

  utter_prompt_verse4:
  - text: |

            With one of the nice rhymes above
            Or ending with one of your own
            One last verse to you I request:
            don't worry, I'll take care of the rest!

  utter_complete:

           I need no more information:
           Get ready to read our creation!

            There was a {how} {who} of {where}
            {verse2}

            {verse4}.
            That {how} {who} of {where}!
