            Hi! How's it going? I was wondering whether
            or not we shall write a limerick together

            I'm Richard Lime, but you can call me Rick!
            I can help you write poems in a way nice and quick.
            I have a knack for weird, nonsense verse
            and with a limerick we can rehearse!

  utter_intro:
  - text: |
            A limerick is a nonsense composition
            belonging to the English tradition.
            It lasts five lines (AABBA)
            and we can write one if you think that's okay

            The limerick packs laughs anatomical
            Into space that is quite economical.
            But the good ones I've seen
            So seldom are clean
            And the clean ones so seldom are comical.

            I need a who, a where and a how!
