# Rick Lime
I'm Richard Lime, but you can call me Rick.  
I can help you write poems in a way nice and quick.  
I have a knack for weird, nonsense verse  
And with a limerick we can rehearse!  
I never utter a line with no rhymes  
but that doesn't mean I'm not serious sometimes.  
I'm really young and was written to pass  
the MLT Master's Dialogue Systems class  
so please, download me and put me to test,  
find bugs and submit a pull request!  

## A typical conversation with Rick
```
Your input ->  hey                                           
Hi! How's it going? I was wondering whether
Or not we shall write a limerick together

Your input ->  limerick!?                                    
A limerick is a nonsense composition
Belonging to the English tradition.
It lasts five lines (AABBA)
And we can write one if you think that's okay

Your input ->  show me an example                            
The limerick packs laughs anatomical
Into space that is quite economical.
But the good ones I've seen
So seldom are clean
And the clean ones so seldom are comical.

Your input ->  okay, let's start                             
What do you want it to be about?
I need a who, a where and a how!

Your input ->  about a weird bird                            
Where does the action takes place this round?
Enter a region, country or town

Your input ->  in Paris                                      
About the bird I want to know more:
Writing the second verse is your chore.
To rhyme with Paris don't you forget!
And if in trouble, read what I suggest:

terrace, embarrass, polaris, harris, ferrous
Your input ->  who every other bird would embarrass          
To the short middle verses we've come:
write down the first one and I'll tell you some
rhymes you could use to make the second fun
so that you're able to choose the best one

Your input ->  for when songs he chirped                     
excerpt, usurped, slurped

With one of the nice rhymes above
Or ending with one of your own
One last verse to you I request:
don't worry, I'll take care of the rest!

Your input ->  he was not much skilled                       
I need no more information:
Get ready to read our creation!

There was a weird bird of Paris
who every other bird would embarrass
for when songs he chirped
he was not much skilled.
That weird bird of Paris!

How did you like it? I think it's not bad.
Don't worry, if you hate it I won't be sad.

Your input ->  it was horrible!                              
Maybe it's because I'm a little bit hoarse
But do believe me: it could have been worse!

Your input ->  like what?                                    
There was a young man from Japan
Whose limericks never would scan.
And when they asked why,
He said "I do try!
But when I get to the last line I try to fit in as many words as I can.

Your input ->  hahaha, goodbye!                              
Well then, goodbye, I'll now disappear
but when you need me I'm always here!
