# Rick Lime
I'm Richard Lime, but you can call me Rick.  
I can help you write poems in a way nice and quick.  
I have a knack for weird, nonsense verse  
And with a limerick we can rehearse!  
I never utter a line with no rhymes  
but that doesn't mean I'm not serious sometimes.  
I'm really young and was written to pass  
the MLT Master's Dialogue Systems class  
so please, download me and put me to test,  
find bugs and submit a pull request!
